        <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">A <u><mark>gun</mark></u> is a device designed to propel a projectile using pressure or explosive force.[1][2] The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile" target="_blank">projectiles</a>are typically solid, but can also be pressurized liquid (e.g. in water guns/cannons), or gas (e.g. light-gas gun). Solid projectiles may be free-flying (as with bullets and artillery shells) or tethered (as with Tasers, spearguns and harpoon guns). A large-caliber gun is also called a <mark>cannon.</mark></p> <br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">The means of projectile propulsion vary according to designs, but are traditionally effected pneumatically by a high gas pressure contained within a barrel tube (gun barrel), produced either through the rapid exothermic combustion of propellants (as with firearms), or by mechanical compression (as with air guns). <br> The high-pressure gas is introduced behind the projectile, pushing and accelerating it down the length of the tube, imparting sufficient launch velocity to sustain its further travel towards the target once the propelling gas ceases acting upon it after it exits the muzzle. <br> Alternatively, new-concept linear motor weapons may employ an electromagnetic field to achieve acceleration, in which case the barrel may be substituted by guide rails (as in railguns) or wrapped with magnetic coils (as in coilguns).</p>

        <p style="font-weight: bolder;">5.Never point the gun at anything you don't intend to destroy.</p> <br>
        <p style="font-weight: bolder;">6.Be sure of your target and what is beyond it.</p> <br>
        <p style="font-weight: bolder;">7.Learn the mechanical and handling characteristics of the gun you are using.</p> <br>
        <p style="font-weight: bolder;">8.Always use proper Ammunition.</p> <br>
        <p style="font-weight: bolder;">9.Be sure the barrel is clear of obstructions before loading and shooting.</p> <br>
        <p style="font-weight: bolder;">10.If your gun fails to fire when the trigger is pulled, hold your shooting position for several seconds; <br> then with the muzzle pointed in a safe direction, carefully unload the gun.</p> <br>
        <p style="font-weight: bolder;">11.Don't rely on the gun's safety to keep it from firing.</p> <br>
        <p style="font-weight: bolder;">12.Be aware of your surroundings when handling guns so you don't trip or lose your balance and accidentally <br> point and/or fire the gun at anyone or anything.</p> <br>
